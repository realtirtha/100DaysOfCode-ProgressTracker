##Day 4

* Today:
    * I reviewed things i have learned before.
    * I learned about the difference between Git and GitHub.
    * I also look about fork, pull request and reviews but I probably need to practice in more like projects to learn better of it.
    * I also managed my GitHub Profile. Click [here](https://github.com/realtirtha) to visit
    * I also made github.io profile but i did only copy paste from bootstrap but still a little worth.
